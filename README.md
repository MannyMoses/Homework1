Code Refactoring 

In this project, the marketing agency wanted to make sure that their website was fully up to accessibility standards. I proceeded to clean up their code making it easier to distinguish, which html elements linked to what. A majority of it was changing tags from <div> to whatever corresponding tag was most appropriate. Then from there making sure that the code followed a logical order so that the next person to look at it would have an easy lay of the land.
